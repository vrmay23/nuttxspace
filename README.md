# `nuttxspace` - NuttX & Apps Version Management

This repository (`nuttxspace`) acts as a wrapper to manage specific versions of the Apache NuttX RTOS and its associated applications (`nuttx-apps`) using Git submodules. It includes scripts for synchronization, updating, and maintaining your development environment.

---

## Project Structure

* **`nuttx/`**: Submodule containing the Apache NuttX RTOS source code.
* **`apps/`**: Submodule containing the Apache NuttX applications source code.
* **`tests/`**: Directory for tests or related NuttX projects.
* **`LICENSE`**: File containing the project's license.
* **`clone_branch.sh`**: The primary script to select and synchronize the `nuttx` and `apps` submodule versions.
* **`update_myRepo.sh`**: Script to commit and push your local `nuttxspace` changes to your remote repository.
* **`get_updates.sh`**: Script to synchronize your `nuttxspace` repository with updates from an upstream remote.
* **`.nuttxsync`**: (This file is automatically generated by `clone_branch.sh` and tracked by Git) - Records the synced `nuttx` and `apps` submodule commit hashes.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_NUTTXSPACE_REPO_URL.git]
    cd nuttxspace
    ```

2.  **Initialize and Sync Submodules (First Time or to Change Versions):**
    Use the `clone_branch.sh` script to choose the specific NuttX and apps version you want to work with. This script will perform a deep clean and clone the correct submodules.

    ```bash
    ./clone_branch.sh
    ```
    Follow the on-screen instructions to select your desired version (e.g., `9.0`, `10.3`, `master`, etc.).

## Utility Scripts

### `clone_branch.sh` (or `set_branch.sh`)

This script is the main tool for setting up and switching between different versions of NuttX and its applications. It will:

1.  List common branches available in both the `apache/nuttx` and `apache/nuttx-apps` repositories.
2.  Allow you to interactively choose a version (e.g., `9.0`, `10.3`, `master`).
3.  De-initialize and remove existing local copies of the `nuttx` and `apps` submodules.
4.  Clone the `nuttx` and `nuttx-apps` repositories to the selected branch/version.
5.  Update the submodule references in your main repository and log the commit hashes in the `.nuttxsync` file.
6.  Configure and compile the NuttX simulator for the `sim:nsh` architecture.

**Usage:**
```bash
./clone_branch.sh
